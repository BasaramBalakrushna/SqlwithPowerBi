Overview

This project identifies the maximum sales values for two sales representatives (Abhay and Anshika) across customers and regions, using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for visualization.

Steps Performed

Connected three datasets: additional, data, and customers.

Merged datasets: Used UNION ALL to combine additional and data (same columns).

Created combined_data: Stored the merge result as a new dataset.

Joined with customers: Used a subquery to join combined_data with customers on customer_code.

Created sample_data1: Stored the join result as a new dataset.

Aggregated sales: Wrote a query to get MAX(sales) grouped by sales_rep, customer, and region.

Filtered reps: Selected only Abhay and Anshika using HAVING.

Sorted results: Ordered by customer (ASC) and region (DESC).

Created datatable2: Saved the summarized result into a new dataset.

Visualized in Power BI: Imported datatable2 into Power BI.

Built chart: Used a Cluster Column Chart to display max sales.

Added slicer: Added a slicer to filter by customer.

Insights: Final chart shows max sales by sales_rep across region and customer â€” clear visibility on who sold what, where, and how much.

SQL Code Used

-- Use the correct database
USE batchBB;

-- View joined dataset
SELECT * FROM sample_data1;

-- Create summarized dataset
SELECT sales_rep, customer, region, MAX(sales) AS max_sales 
INTO datatable2 
FROM sample_data1 
GROUP BY sales_rep, customer, region 
HAVING sales_rep = 'abhay' OR sales_rep = 'anshika' 
ORDER BY customer, region DESC;

-- View the final result
SELECT * FROM datatable2;

Deliverables

SQL Scripts: Data preparation, merging, joining, and aggregation.

Power BI Dashboard: Cluster Column Chart + Customer slicer.

Insights: Clear view of sales performance for targeted sales reps.

Key Insight

This approach provides a clean, efficient way to monitor top sales per rep, region, and customer, enabling data-driven decisions.
