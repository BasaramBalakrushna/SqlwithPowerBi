Connected three datasets: additional, data, and customers.

Used UNION ALL to merge additional and data (same columns).

Stored the result as a new dataset: combined_data.

Used a subquery to join combined_data with customers on customer_code.

Created a new dataset from that join: sample_data1.

Wrote a query to get max(sales) by sales_rep, customer, and region.

Filtered only two reps: Abhay and Anshika using HAVING.

Sorted the results by customer and region DESC.

Saved the result into a new dataset: datatable2.

Opened Power BI and imported the dataset.

Used a cluster column chart to visualize data.

Added a slicer for filtering by customer.

Final chart shows max sales by sales_rep across region and customer.

Clean, clear insights on who sold what, where, and how much!
